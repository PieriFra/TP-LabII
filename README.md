# Tromino Tiling ‚Äì Chessboard Coverage Problem (Lab II)

‚ôüÔ∏è **Academic project for Programming Laboratory II**  
This repository contains a C# implementation of the **Chessboard Coverage Problem** (also known as the **Tromino Tiling Problem**).  
The project was developed as a game-like application to practice **algorithm design and recursive programming**.
---

## üìñ Problem Description
The **Chessboard Coverage Problem** consists of:
- A chessboard of size `2^n x 2^n`.
- One arbitrary missing square.
- The goal is to cover the entire board with **L-shaped tromino tiles** (three squares connected in an ‚ÄúL‚Äù shape), without overlapping and leaving only the missing square uncovered.

This problem is a classic example for practicing **divide-and-conquer algorithms** and recursive thinking.

## üöÄ Project Objectives
- Implement the **recursive algorithm** to solve the tiling problem.
- Visualize the solution on a chessboard through a **Windows Forms application**.
- Apply programming concepts learned in **Programming Laboratory II**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET Framework (Windows Forms)  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio

## üéÆ How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PieriFra/Tromino-Tiling.git
   
2. Open in Visual Studio:
Load TP-Lab-II.sln.

3. Build the solution:
Ensure the correct .NET Framework version is installed (e.g., .NET Framework 4.x).

4. Run the application:
 - Choose a board size 2^n x 2^n.
 - Select the missing square.
 - Watch the algorithm cover the board step by step.

## üå± Learning Outcomes
 - Applying divide-and-conquer techniques.
 - Implementing recursive algorithms in C#.
 - Visualizing abstract algorithmic problems through a simple game interface.

## üì∏ Future Improvements
- Add color-coded tiles for better visualization.
- Allow step-by-step animation of the recursive process.
- Extend to other tiling or covering problems.
